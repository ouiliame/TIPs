This is the suggested template for new TIPs. Not all TIPs need to follow this structure, but it may be helpful to understand the spirit of this document's organization and adapt it for your uses.

A TIP number will be assigned by the maintainers of the TIPs repository.

## Simple Summary

Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the TIP. Be sure to include relevant history and context to make sure the audience can understand.

## Abstract

A short (~200) word description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for TIPs that want to change the Terra protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the TIP solves. TIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, and supply technical context within the assumed runtime (for instance, Golang or Python).

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion

## Backwards Compatibility

All TIPs that may concern consensus issues and introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing them and their severity. The TIP author must explain how to deal with these incompatibilities, and ideally should be ratified in a formal, on-chain governance proposal.

## Implementation

The implementations must be completed before any TIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

## Notable Problems

All TIPs should add a section where challenges, potential risks are entertained, as well as ideas on how they may be addressed. Feel free to open up an Agora post to gather community input in refining your ideas.
